      <h2>A journal of an expat girl in Shanghai, having a well paying job, but missing her husband</h2>
      <h5>Shanghai, Sep 19, 2018</h5>
      <div class="img1" style="height:200px;"></div>
      <p>She is writing knowing that she will not see her husband for the next 26 days, and already there has been more than double that she didn’t see him. She has a great job that she sometimes hates. She has great colleagues that can be good friends, but also a burden. She is not alone in this big city, although everyone whispers that she is. No husband, no relatives here, they say. She didn’t feel any different with her family near, but she doesn’t say it. She feels more herself without them, no point in mentioning. It is not that she doesn’t like her big family. Two sisters, parents, four dogs, an aunt, a gramma and other near and far relatives. She just doesn't miss them. Doesn’t miss explaining each and every step of what she is doing. Doesn’t miss coffees each Tuesday (or possibly Wednesday depending on their occupations). Doesn’t miss the silences and unspoken words, complainings and expectations. She has warmth inside which reminds her of the true family values. She could sometimes feel it with them, but mostly she feels it in her heart. So, she is not alone. She carries her family in her heart.
